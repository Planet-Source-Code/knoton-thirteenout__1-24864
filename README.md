### Description

Thirteen Out is a patience I made to figure out how to draw 3 cards from a number of cards in a deck and in the end of the deck put the last 1-2 cards in the beginning of the deck.

The card values are hold in an array and when you throw one card away I needed to figure out how to rearrange the array. So basically it is a projekt

to figure out the algorithm of moving arrays irregular and still keep track of the correct value.

Although it is a fully functional patience it still need some finishing touches..

Enjoy it
